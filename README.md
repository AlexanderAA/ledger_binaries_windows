Ledger binaries for Windows systems
===================================

**Fully automated build and packaging will be really welcome in case anyone wants to work on that - see https://github.com/AlexanderAA/ledger_binaries_windows/issues/5 and https://github.com/AlexanderAA/ledger_binaries_windows/issues/6**

Some instructions for windows builds can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/maxwell-k/ledger-windows-build).
Note: I did not verify the 3.x.x binaries below, it is highly recommended to build your own binaries directly from ledger sources available from https://www.ledger-cli.org

- Ledger 2.6.1 binaries for windows systems - compiled by me
