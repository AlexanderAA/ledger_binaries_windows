=======================

Ledger 2.6.1 binaries for windows systems - compiled by me

Ledger 3.1.1 binaries (x64) for windows systems - submitted by [orlandow](https://github.com/orlandow)


It is really time consuming to compile ledger under windows (you need to download cygwin, etc.). As a result, I decided to make ledger windows binaries available here.

Thanks to John Wiegley for creating ledger!
