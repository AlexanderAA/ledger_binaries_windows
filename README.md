Ledger binaries for Windows systems
===================================

Ledger 2.6.1 binaries for windows systems - compiled by me

Ledger 3.1.1 binaries (x64) for windows systems - submitted by [orlandow](https://github.com/orlandow)

Ledger 3.1.2 binaries for windows systems - submitted by [fraga](https://github.com/fraga), build instructions from 
https://github.com/maxwell-k/ledger-windows-build

It is really time consuming to manually compile ledger under windows. As a result, I decided to make ledger windows binaries available here.

**It is 2019 now - automated build configuration and package scripts will be really welcome in case anyone wants to work on that - see https://github.com/AlexanderAA/ledger_binaries_windows/issues/5 and https://github.com/AlexanderAA/ledger_binaries_windows/issues/6**

Thanks to John Wiegley for creating ledger!
