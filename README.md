Ledger binaries for Windows systems
===================================

Note: I did not verify the 3.x.x binaries below, it is highly recommended to build your own binaries directly from ledger sources available from https://www.ledger-cli.org

Newer versions and chocolatey package maintained by [FullofQuarks](https://github.com/FullofQuarks):
- https://github.com/FullofQuarks/Windows-Ledger-Binaries
- https://chocolatey.org/packages/ledger

Some instructions for windows builds can be found in [here](https://github.com/maxwell-k/ledger-windows-build).
